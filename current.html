			in India</h5>
		<p class="text-justify">
			PURPOSE: With the dynamic technological advancement, the dependency on cyberspace has escalated. Concepts
			and terminologies that seldom existed years ago have now infused in our day-to-day life, as cyber-crime,
			computer-related crime, information crime, or internet crime. The crime that occurs with the aid of a
			computer, internet, or any device is known as cyber-crime. Due to the accumulation of colossal amounts of
			data which may include complaint text or investigation description, there is a need for automated systems
			that can segregate and classify them into different sections.<br />
			APPROACH: In India, these kinds of crimes are tackled by cybercrime cells and these criminal acts committed
			may involve cyber terrorism, hacking, online stacking, online fraud, identity theft, or sending of offensive
			messages or circulation of obscene or toxic material. Under IT Act 2000, there are primarily two sections
			that deal with the majority of these punishable offenses: section 66 involves computer-related offenses
			while section 67 involves punishment for transmitting obscene or toxic content. With the help of artificial
			intelligence, machine learning, ensemble learning, and natural language processing, we have proposed a
			hybrid model that will be beneficial in automating complaint text/ sentence.<br />
			FINDINGS: The outcome depicts the proposed model which is a hybrid of 4 algorithms that gives high
			prediction accuracy of 96.55%. The ensemble learning methodology increased the accuracy of the proposed
			model. The reason behind this method combines a diverse set of learners (individual models) to improvise on
			the stability and predictive power of the model.
			Practical implication: The outcome of the proposed study could improve the existing ways to tackle
			cybercrime and automate the process to categorize the data. It could bring about the advancement in the
			jurisdiction to tackle any problem.<br />
			PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The research would enable the developers and researchers in the domain of cybercrime
			to
			investigate further with the development and collection of more data and experiment with more efficient
			frameworks that can deal with complex real world data.<br />

			<h5 class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-4 ">CONQUER COVID-19 - An Application using Flutter and ML</h5>
			<p class="text-justify">
				PURPOSE: The "CONQUER COVID-19 App" has many different modules for different purposes, namely “COVID
				PREDICTOR”, disparaging the viral fake news with “FAKE NEWS” module, “Locational Threat Analyzer” module
				which lets users know about the nearby “Containment Zones”, and “COVID Updates” module which let people
				to
				be aware about the COVID-19 vaccines updates,
				not that but the users can see the “COVID Stories” of the recovered patients.<br />
				APPROACH: The mobile app is developed using the Flutter Mobile UI Framework. All the
				modules use programming/scripting languages like Python 3 and Dart and different ranging levels of
				technologies/techniques like Time Series Forecasting ML, Web Scrapping, Web Server, Firebase Services
				and
				Flutter.<br />
				FINDINGS: The whole approach we have used in Flutter lead to some complications, some of them severally
				limiting our efficiency such as spaghetti code across multiple modules in our mobile app, also the lack
				of
				code sharing on the daily basis and no support for live code run and debug session we have been least
				efficient. To avoid the spaghetti code in Flutter codebase, we must use some sort of “UI State
				Management”.
				To deploy the web scrapping and cleaning scripts, we must need a web server which will regularly update
				the
				data to Cloud Fire store. We have used “Time Series Forecasting” Technique to predict the next 7-days
				forecast of COVID-19 Case. To achieve 80+ accuracy in the Time Series Forecasting Machine Learning
				Model,
				the data required to train and test must be accurate.<br />
				PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This “Conquer COVID-19” application will provide complete guidance, awareness,
				and
				knowledge about COVID-19 disease. This is a one-stop information hub particularly organized for the
				COVID-19
				disease. Our app is a cross platform mobile application, which is all about knowing, & getting
				synchronized
				with the latest updates of COVID-19 disease. It will be very useful for all types of people out there.
				They don't have to scour
				through many websites and apps and it will give them the ease of availability of information. This also
				encourages other developers to build a product like this.
