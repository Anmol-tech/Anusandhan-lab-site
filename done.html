		<p class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-2">
			PURPOSE: In this era of internet, slight mistake can lead hackers into user system. The prime purpose of the
			project is to look for such vulnerabilities and prevent cyberattacks through web apps. <br />
			APPROACH: This project discusses about deployment of a xss vulnerability scanner that crawls through various
			parts of input website to find the locations of possible threat.<br />
			FINDINGS: Applying this project to a local server we have seen that various overlooked vulnerabilities are
			given as output.<br />
			PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Such scanner has great importance in todays market as everyone thrives to make their
			website more and more secure which is not completely possible with manual testing hence such script help in
			real time detection of potential threats.

			<h5 class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-4">Recyclable Item Detection Model Using Machine Learning</h5>
			<p class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-2">
				PURPOSE:
				When people are throwing away something seemingly useless, they are often in doubt: Is this recyclable
				or
				not? Recyclable items are valuable material rather than trash. By reusing recyclable items, a huge
				amount of
				energy cost to manufacture new materials and to deal with waste can be saved to help sustain a greener
				living environment for us all. Many kinds of glass, paper, metal, plastic, textiles, and electronics are
				recyclable materials, and should not be put into trash bins where non-recyclable materials should stay.
				But
				can people memorize all that recycling knowledge? No. However, with the help of specific software,
				images of
				items that will be thrown away can be processed by computer vision and classified by supervised machine
				learning methods, thus intelligently tell users the recyclability of their items without pain.<br />
				APPROACH:
				Data about recyclable as well as non-recyclable items are collected from a variety of resources. As the
				dataset of this project was not available online it was created and then divided into two categories
				i.e.
				recyclable and non-recyclable. It was further trained on a machine learning algorithm i.e. CNN.<br />
				FINDINGS:
				So far we have received an accuracy of 82%.<br />
				PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
				The result in this study could help in the development of the smarts bins. thrives to make their website
				more and more secure which is not completely possible with manual testing hence such script help in real
				time detection of potential threats.

		<h5 class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-4">Automated Human following bot</h5>
		<p class="d-flex justify-content-center mt-2">
			PURPOSE: Robots that can follow its human companion that can also interact and co-exist with them.<br />

			APPROACH: a robot needs a mechanism that enables it to visualize the person and according to its
			environment. The robot must be intelligent enough to follow a person in crowded areas, indoors and outdoors
			places. Typically human following robots are equipped with several different diverse combination of sensors
			i.e. light detection and ranging sensor, radio frequency identification module (RFID), laser range finder
			(LFR), infrared (IR) sensing modules, thermal imaging sensors, camera, wireless transmitter/receiver etc.
			for recognition and locating the target.<br />

			FINDINGS: The model needs to be accurate enough to detect and differentiate between people and should also
			be able to find its companion when human goes out of frame.<br />

			PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This can be very useful at airports, shopping complexes and even as a indoor human
			companion for old people or people who need constant monitoring.<br />
